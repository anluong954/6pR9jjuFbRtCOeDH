This is a project called happy Customers. 
The company has gotten feedback from customers using a survey, and we are presented with a subset of the data. The goal of the project is to create a model that give a 73% accuracy rate to predict if the customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to the question asked.
For this project, I chose to use 4 different method to find the accuracy scores and F1 scores. The four different methods were Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, K-nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost.
